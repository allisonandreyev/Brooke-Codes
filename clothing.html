    <h1> Clothing </h1>
    <h4> There are multiple different aspects to Ukrainian clothing, both traditional and nontraditional. </h4> 
    <p> Common customs in traditional clothing include these essential aspects. For example, while married women usually cover their heads with shawls and complete their outfits with maxi skirts and waistcoats, girls are only required to wear shirts without outerwear. The jewelry, belts, and headpieces (such as a shawl or floral wreath), which are sometimes embellished with ribbons and real or fake flowers, as well as the profusion of beads and ducats (coins), are also what make women's attire stand out. Men's traditional attire is more straightforward, similar to that of other Slavic countries, but it is worn differently. A linen shirt and fabric pants, which can be recognized by the type of embroidery, make up the two primary components. </p>
    <h4> Some Examples of Traditional Clothing Includes: </h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Vyshyvanka: A key component of Ukraine's national attire is the embroidered shirt or dress known as a "vyshyvanka," the word used in Ukrainian. The shirts are traditionally made of linen, and the elaborate, vibrant, colorful designs often highlight aspects of the Ukrainian environment or cultural ideals. Plants, animals, and geometric shapes are the three basic motifs that frequently appear in vyshyvanka patterns. </li>

    <li>Kokoshnik: The kokoshnik is a traditional Russian headdress worn by ladies and girls to accompany the sarafan. It continues to be a significant aspect of Russian folk culture and dance groups today and also inspired the Kokoshnik architectural style. </li>

    <li>Sarafan: A sarafan is a loosely fitting long jumper dress worn over a long linen shirt and belted. It is one of the vital components of traditional Slavic dress and a belt is often worn under the sarafan. </li>

    <li>Poneva: The poneva skirt is patterned or striped fabric wrapped around the hips or gathered on a string,  worn below a long, loose shirt. Young women usually wear plain long shirts with embroidered sleeves and bottoms fastened around the waist with a belt and a poneva. </li>

    <li> Ushanka: A Russian fur hat with ear-covering flaps that can be attached to the cap's crown or knotted at the chin to shield the ears, jaw, and lower chin from the cold is known as an ushanka, sometimes known as an ushanka-hat. An alternative way to wear it is to bend the flaps back and tie them behind the head, called "ski-style," which provides less weather protection but significantly improved visibilityâ€”essential for high-speed skiing. Additionally, the thick fur offers some defense against blows to the brain.  </li>
