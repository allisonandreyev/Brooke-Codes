## About this website:
### Our team has worked to **expand all of our Horizons** this weekend when creating this website. Some members of our team, _never had the experience of coding themselves_ before this hackathon, and we all didnt know much about Ukranian culture. After completing our project we have learned so much about **Slavic culture**, and running official programming applications such as **VS code**, which we had to download as we didnt have experience with it. We also got to _learn how to use CSS_ to decorate a webpage and how to make a website interactive through _sensing in Javascript_, in which none of us had experience with. Overall, we all learned so much and participating in Brooke Codes Hackathon was a wonderful experience.

## Our inspiration for this webpage was our love of **scrapbooking** and **Slavic cultures** in countries like _Ukraine_. 

## Our website informs about Ukraine's culture and various aspects of it in the form of a scrapbook. _It's full of pictures, colorful texts,_ and even _features to change the colors of backgrounds_ and text to resemble _scrapbooking's remarkable and unique aspects._ 

## We primarily used **HTML** and some **CSS** and **JavaScript** to build the webpage. As for our content, we used various resources online. 

## One of the main challenges we ran into was attempting to make our website more interactive and add **interactive elements like a quiz, color-changing mechanisms**, etc. We also had a _lot of bugs in styling_ and overall properties which had to be fixed and debugged by all of us. Trying to input code to provide these results successfully was a lengthy process. 

## There were accomplishments in our process that we were proud of. For example, we _learned new aspects of HTML and JavaScript_ and successfully applied them to our website. We successfully managed to **input color-changing elements** and other **interactive elements** to our webpage, which was a challenge we had to face. We also worked together time effectively and put a lot of content and elements into our web pages. 

## We learned about various new _HTML commands_, including commands that create **new webpages, add interactive elements, add images**, etc. We also learned how to manage our time more effectively throughout the event and manage communication.

## Our plans for the web pages include improving the **interactive aspects of the site**, for example, allowing users to take an online quiz to see what they learned and actually allow them to see their results. Another plan we have to _improve our site is to innovate the design, for example, by adding more fonts, design elements_ (like decorative lines and shapes), more professional color schemes, etc. Also, making a scrapbook for other countries and linking them to the website would be amazing!
